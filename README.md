# fpscript
Script to build the latest Flashpoint Infinity for Linux systems


All you need is "fpscript.sh", the rest should be downloaded from the script. (if not you should be able to fix this with some shell script knowledge, but please make an issue/pr)

# Warning
**this hasnt been tested that well yet, please make [github issues](https://github.com/j0lol/fpscript/issues) if you run into any errors, along with flashpoint logs if required.**

**please report problems with flashpoint itself to the correct place ([manual](https://bluemaxima.org/flashpoint/Manual.pdf), [discord](https://bluemaxima.org/flashpoint/discord)), i dont own flashpoint**
